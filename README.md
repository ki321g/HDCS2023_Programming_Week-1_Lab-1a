Processing Exercises

Exercises
The exercises are typically based on the functions we covered in the previous steps in this lab (and the associated lectures).

For each exercise listed below, open a new sketch.

In this module, the Challenge Exercises are exactly thatâ€¦challenges! So if you can't do them straight away (or at all), don't panic. In most cases, they require additional thinking and research. You may need to visit the Processing website for additional information to attempt them.
