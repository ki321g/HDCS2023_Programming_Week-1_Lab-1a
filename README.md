# Higher Diploma in Computer Science 2023
# Week_1 - Lab-1a

Exercises
The exercises are typically based on the functions we covered in the previous steps in this lab (and the associated lectures).

For each exercise listed below, open a new sketch.

In this module, the Challenge Exercises are exactly thatâ€¦challenges! So if you can't do them straight away (or at all), don't panic. In most cases, they require additional thinking and research. You may need to visit the Processing website for additional information to attempt them.

# Exercise_1
Processing: Replicate the basic Microsoft logo as shown in the picture below:

Hint: You could use [this website](http://designpieces.com/2014/11/brand-colours/) to find the exact Microsoft RGB colours in their logo.

# Exercise_2
Processing: Replicate the beats (Dr. Dre) logo as shown in the picture below:

# Exercise_3
Processing: Convert the Microsoft logo into a grayscale logo as shown in the picture below:

Hint: the easiest way to do this is to use the grayscale fill function as opposed to the RBG version of it. The grayscale version of fill takes one parameter, a number between 0 and 255 inclusive. This numver represents a shade of gray between black (0) and white (255) e.g.:

```
    fill(150);   //sets a medium gray colour for all shapes drawn after it
    fill(0);     //sets a black colour for all shapes drawn after it
    fill(255);   //sets a white colour for all shapes drawn after it
```

#  Challenge_1
Write the code that will draw the typical control buttons you would see on a media player. An example image would be:

Hint: you will need to read up on the triangle() function on the [Processing website](https://processing.org/reference/triangle_.html)

# Challenge_2
Processing: Draw any picture you fancy as your profile picture for social media. No need to actually change your profile picture, just play around with drawing one!
